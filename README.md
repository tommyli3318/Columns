# Columns 2 (Read for instructions on starting the game)
Pygame version of the classic video game Columns, with my own twist added

***IMPORTANT***

TRYING TO RUN THE GAME BY JUST DOUBLE-CLICKING main.py MIGHT NOT WORK!

First download the folder and unzip it

Launch the game in one of the following ways:

1) run main.py using IDLE or another Python workspace

2) run main.py with terminal/cmd: 
	- In cmd/terminal enter: cd [Columns-2 directory file path]
	- Then enter: python main.py

**Note**

The game runs on Python 3 and the pygame module, WHICH I DO NOT OWN! I have simply included it as part of the download for convenience

All credits of pygame go to pygame Community @ www.pygame.org

**Controls:**

Left/Right arrows to move the falling block

Space to rotate the colors of the falling block

Down Arrow to drop the falling block instantly


**Gameplay:**


Match 3 or more blocks of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to make them dissapear

Matching more blocks at the same time will reward more points

With each match, the speed of the game increases

If any column fills up to the top, you lose


**Changelog:**

v1.0 implemented matching

v1.1 bug fixes

v1.2 scoring system added

v1.3 added grid, code optimized

v1.4 added instant drop

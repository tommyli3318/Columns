# Columns 2
Pygame version of the classic video game Columns, with my own twist added


**Controls:**

Left/Right arrows to move the falling block

Space to rotate the colors of the falling block

Down Arrow to drop the falling block instantly


**Gameplay:**

Download the folder, unzip it, and run main.py to start the game (runs on Python 3 and pygame module)

Match 3 or more blocks of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to make them dissapear

Matching more blocks at the same time will reward more points

With each match, the speed of the game increases

If any column fills up to the top, you lose

v1.0 implemented matching

v1.1 bug fixes

v1.2 scoring system added

v1.3 added grid, code optimized

v1.4 added instant drop
